## Overview

This beautiful challenge gave me the opportunity of pursuing pixel perfectness. I've tried to keep things simple by playing mainly with flexbox, while discovering design dimensions and colors using [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/)'s measuring tool and color picker. This workflow led me to a very satisfactory result.
